# Azure Global Infrastructure : R&D Document
# 🌐 Microsoft Azure Global Infrastructure Overview

Microsoft Azure's global infrastructure is engineered to deliver **high availability**, **resiliency**, **compliance**, and **performance** for cloud services across the globe. It leverages a combination of physical data centers, logical groupings (regions and geographies), and high-speed networking.

## 🗺️ Azure Geographies

An **Azure Geography** is a distinct market, often aligned with a specific country or continent, and contains one or more Azure regions.

- Designed to meet **data residency** and **compliance** requirements (e.g., finance, healthcare).
- Each geography is **isolated** from others to handle large-scale disasters.
- Connected by Microsoft’s **global high-capacity network**.

**Examples:** United States, India, Europe, Australia, Azure Government (for U.S. agencies)

## 🌍 Azure Regions

An **Azure Region** is a set of data centers located in a specific geographic area, interconnected through a **low-latency**, **high-bandwidth** network.

- Core deployment unit for Azure services.
- Enables performance optimization and compliance by keeping resources close to users.
- Over **60+ regions** operational worldwide.
- **Region Pairs** enable seamless disaster recovery.

**Examples:**  
- `East US` (Virginia)  
- `West Europe` (Netherlands)  
- `Central India` (Pune)  
- `Australia East` (New South Wales)

## 🏢 Availability Zones (AZs)

**Availability Zones** are unique physical locations within an Azure region, each with its own **independent power, cooling, and network**.

- Protects apps/data from **data center-level failures**.
- Regions can have **1–3+ AZs**, each containing one or more data centers.
- Ensures **high availability** and **redundancy**.

> Azure currently operates **126 Availability Zones**, expanding to **163+**.

**Regions with AZs:** East US, West Europe, Central India, Australia East, etc.

## 🧱 Data Centers

Azure **Data Centers** are physical facilities that host compute, storage, and networking infrastructure.

- Grouped into **regions**, and organized into **availability zones**.
- Over **80 data centers** globally, in cities like:
  - Virginia (East US)
  - Frankfurt (Germany West Central)
  - Dublin (North Europe)
  - Toronto (Canada Central)
  - Sydney (Australia East)

- Interconnected via Microsoft's **global WAN**, including:
  - Fiber optics  
  - Points of Presence (PoPs)  
  - Regional gateways
