# Azure Global Infrastructure : R&D Document
# 🌐 Microsoft Azure Global Infrastructure Overview

Microsoft Azure's global infrastructure is designed to deliver high availability, resiliency, and compliance for cloud services worldwide. It is built on a combination of physical data centers, logical groupings (regions and geographies), and advanced networking to ensure robust performance and data sovereignty.

## 🗺️ Azure Geographies

- An **Azure Geography** is a distinct market, often aligned with a specific country or continent, and contains one or more Azure regions.

- An Azure geography is a discrete market, typically corresponding to a country or continent, that contains one or more Azure regions.

- Geographies are designed to meet specific data residency and compliance requirements. For example, regulated data (financial, healthcare, etc.) may be required by law to remain within a specific geography.

- Each geography is isolated from others to withstand large-scale events and is connected by Microsoft’s high-capacity global network.

- Examples of Azure geographies include United States, India, Europe, Australia, and specialized offerings like Azure Government (for US government agencies

## 🌍 Azure Regions

- An Azure region is a set of data centers deployed within a specific geographic area, connected through a low-latency, high-bandwidth network.

- Each region is a fundamental deployment area for Azure resources, allowing customers to place applications and data close to users for better performance and compliance.

- Azure has more global regions than any other cloud provider, with over 60 operational regions and more under development.

- Regions are often paired within the same geography for disaster recovery, enabling seamless failover and data redundancy.

- Examples: East US (Virginia), West Europe (Netherlands), Central India (Pune), Australia East (New South Wales)

## 🏢 Availability Zones (AZs)

- An Availability Zone (AZ) is a physically separate location within an Azure region, each with its own independent power, cooling, and networking.

- AZs are designed to protect applications and data from data center failures by providing redundancy and high availability within a region.

- Each region can have one to three (or more) availability zones, and each zone consists of one or more data centers.

- Azure currently operates 126 availability zones, with more under development, offering a total of 163 zones soon.

- Not all regions support availability zones; examples of regions with AZs include East US, West Europe, Central India, and Australia East.

## 🧱 Data Centers

- Azure data centers are the physical facilities that house servers, storage, and networking equipment to run cloud services.

- These data centers are grouped into regions and further organized into availability zones for redundancy.

- Microsoft operates over 80 data centers worldwide, with locations in major cities such as Virginia (East US), Frankfurt (Germany West Central), Dublin (North Europe), Toronto (Canada Central), and Sydney (Australia East).

- Data centers are interconnected via Microsoft’s global wide-area network (WAN), which includes fiber, points of presence (PoPs), and regional gateways to ensure low-latency, high-availability connectivity.

## 🚀 Key Features and Benefits


- Global Reach: Azure’s infrastructure spans the globe, providing customers with the flexibility to deploy applications close to their users.

- Resiliency: The combination of geographies, regions, and availability zones ensures high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.

- Compliance: Geographies and regions are designed to comply with local data residency laws and industry regulations.

- Scalability: Azure continues to expand its infrastructure, adding new regions and zones to meet growing customer demand.
